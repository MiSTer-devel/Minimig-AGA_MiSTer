<h3>Action's Guide to AGA-Fixing!</h3>

<p>Don't you hate it! You upgrade your Amiga to a fancy 1200 or 4000, and a lot
of the old software you used to use no longer works! Well there are a number
of people out there fixing games, so here is a brief description of what
is generally required to get games and demos working:</p>

<p>Please note that this section is called "AGA fixing" and most
of the problems will occur with ECS upgraded configurations. 680x0 fixing
may be a more suitable name, but that title does not look as nice as the
current one! So no complaints please!</p>

<p>Greetings must go to Legionary, N.O.M.A.D, Jean François 
Fabre, Bert Jahn, Galahad/Fairlight and numerous others for their help 
in this area. Thanks a lot guys!</p><p>


</p><h4><a name="24BitAddresses">24-bit Addresses</a></h4>

<p>In non-EC CPUs such as 68030, 68040, 68060 (not 68000 nor 680EC20), an 
address is coded in 32 bits, whereas 68000 and 680EC20 only take the 24 
lower bits into consideration when accessing memory, for data or instruction 
fetch.</p>

<p>e.g: on a 68000, if you want to jump to $4000, you can code either of:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        jmp     $4000               ;the simplest
        jmp     $xx004000           ;xx = anything different from zero
                                    ;(the stupidest)</tt></pre><p>

</p><p>Then, jmp $ff004000 will jump to $4000 (the PC will be equal to $ff004000 
but the instuctions will be fetched from $4000 and so on and it won't 
crash.</p>

<p>Conversely, as real 32 bits CPUs don't mask the most significant byte, the 
same instruction jmp $ff004000 executed on a 68040 will cause the cpu to 
fetch the instructions from $FF004000, which will most likely cause a superb 
crash.</p>

<p>"But the programmers never code jmp $ff004000 instead of jmp $4000", 
I hear you say. Yes, but they often use address tables (for fast switch/case) 
like this:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.l  d0,d1
        lsl.l   #2,d1
        lea     addresstable,a0
        move.l  (a0,d1.l),a1
        jsr     (a1)                ;Jump to fetched address
        move.w  #$95,d1
        moveq.l #0,d0

addresstable:
        dc.l    $00004000,$00004046,$0000502A,...</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>A very convenient technique, except if the programmer has the stupid idea to 
use the unused most significant byte of an address (for instance at location 
(addresstable)) to store 1 byte data, such as a counter. Then, the JSR will 
only be correct if the value is 0, else it will crash.</p>

<p>This kind of error is very hard to find, and then you must patch it. It was 
the cause of the crash of Xenon2 and Z-Out, for instance, but only when a 
special bonus was taken.</p>

<p>On Agony it was harder to detect, as some enemies cannot be killed on a 
68060, even with all caches off. This is still a 24 bit problem.</p>

<p>Once found, you can modify the code as follows:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.l  d0,d1
        lsl.l   #2,d1
        lea     addresstable,a0
        move.l  (a0,d1.l),a1
        jsr     My24BitPatch
        NOP
        moveq.l #0,d0</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>Add NOPs as you won't have the room for the jsr (6 bytes vs 2 for JSR (A1)) 
and copy some original code you overwrote:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>My24BitPatch:
        move.l  d0,-(a7)            ;save d0
        move.l  a1,-(a7)            ;save a1
        move.l  a1,d0
        and.l   #$00ffffff,d0       ;filter the MSB (only with data registers)
        move.l  d0,a1
        jsr     (a1)                ;jump
        move.l  (a7)+,a1            ;in case the game uses MSB of a1 (suckers!)
        move.l  (a7)+,d0            ;restore d0
        move.w  #$95,d0             ;original game code
        rts                     ;return</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>This example was adapted from the Xenon 2 patch by Jean François 
Fabre.</p>


<h4><a name="Blitter">Blitter</a></h4>

<p>This is a very frequent problem on the Amiga. You try a game, and the
character flashes, or the game crashes after a few seconds, and the 
screen is corrupt.</p>

<p>In most cases, the game can be played, but the graphic bugs are
annoying. One would think the AGA chipset is the cause but it's not.
For proof, test the faulty game on an accelerated A2000 and the result
is the same.</p>

<p>The problem is that programmers often don't wait for the old blit to
finish before starting another. This is no concern on A500/68000
because they know the blits are over due to the terrible speed of the
68000, but when you upgrade to A1200/020 you see the good coders.</p>

<p>Be aware that some blitter problems cannot be detected even on 68060
processors! This is due to the chipmem access speed on certain cards such 
as the 68060 Blizzard card. It is terribly slow compared to even a standard 
A1200/020 with caches on or a Blizzard 68030-IV card!</p>

<p>There's also some Bltpri configuration which seems to change behaviour 
whether setpatch has been run or not.</p>

<p>To find them, you've got to search for write accesses to $dff058 blitter 
register. It can be found in various flavours in the code:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.w  d1,$dff058</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>or:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        lea      $dff000,a5
        ...
        move.w   #$56,($58,a5)</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>or even:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        lea      $dff048,a6
        ...
        move.w   #$56,($10,a6)</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>As you can see, it can be a real pain in the arse to find these instructions!
Once you do find one, search for more identical instructions in the code. This
is because programmers are generally lazy and if they get some code working,
they will copy and paste it throughout the rest of the program.</p>

<p>To fix blitter problems, you've got to make the CPU wait before or after the 
blit is performed. It sounds natural that if you wait after, you'll lose CPU 
cycles since non-blitter related stuff has to wait. This can slow down the 
game a lot (eg. Mighty Bombjack which performs hundreds of small blits).</p>

<p>If you wait before the blit, non-blitter code will be able to execute in 
parallel with the DMA blit, and the CPU will wait only in the case the old 
blit is not over when you reach the new blit instruction. This synchronization 
is necessary between the CPU and Blitter.</p>

<p>To wait for blitter operation to complete:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>       btst     #6,$dff002          ;dmaconr
wait:  btst     #6,$dff002          ;test twice to fix old bug
       beq.b    wait                ;wait until blitter DMA is over
       &lt;make the blit&gt;</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>If you have the graphics library open, it is safer to call the WaitBlit()
function than code your own - this should be guaranteed to work for
all processors. Unfortunately, most games hit the hardware directly 
so you usually have to insert the code above anyway :(</p>


<h4><a name="ColourBitFixes">Colour Bit Fixes</a></h4>

<p>On some dodgy graphics cards, the screen display will appear corrupt if
the programmer has not set the colour bit in BplCon0 ($dff100):

</p><p></p><pre><tt>Bit 1:      ERSY:   External sync. This line is reset on power up (1 = external, 
                                                                   0 = internal)
Bit 2:      LACE:   Interlace enable. This line is reset on power up (1 = interlaced)
Bit 3:      LPEN:   Light pen enable. This line is reset on power up (1 = enabled)
Bits 4-7:   Unused
Bit 8:      GAUD:   Genlock audio enable (1 = enabled)
Bit 9:      COLOUR: Composite video colour enable (1 = colour, 0 = black and white)
Bit 10:     DBLPF:  Double (dual) playfield mode (1 = dual playfield)
Bit 11:     HOMOD:  Hold-and-modify mode (1 = HAM)
Bits 12-14: BPU:    Bitplanes used
Bit 15:     HIRES:  High resolution mode (1 = high resolution, 0 = low resolution)</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>On Amiga 1000's with colour composite output, you can set this bit equal to 0
to output a monochrome display through the composite video port. This bit has
no affect on the RGB output.</p>

<p>To fix can either be very easy, or a real nightmare! Sometimes you will get lucky
and find the early game setup does something like this:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.w  #$4000,$dff100      ;Setup a 16 colour screen</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>Set bit 9 to fix it, which is the same as adding $200 in the previous example:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.w  #$4200,$dff100      ;16 colour screen with colour bit set</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>Sometimes the game will write the value all through it so you have to manually 
find them all, and other games copy the value from a table and insert it into a 
copperlist on the fly (sometimes an easy fix, other times very difficult). A MMU
combined with WHDLoad comes in very handy for this task!</p>


<h4><a name="Caches">CPU Caches</a></h4>

<p>The CPU caches cause a lot of problems on older software. Self modifying
code and CPU delay loops all fail on anything above a 68020. Turning off
the caches helps the software to run correctly.</p>

<p>To make software run faster, turn on the caches. Remember the data cache
is not enabled on an Amiga 4000/030/040 until the setpatch command has run.</p>

<p>Programmers should use the CacheClearU() or CacheClearE() routines on
KS36+ machines.</p>


<h4><a name="Prefetch">CPU Prefetch</a></h4>

<p>All processors of the 68K family have a prefetch feature. The processor 
assumes that the code will be executed without break of sequence, so it 
prefetches the instructions to avoid memory accesses, and this feature 
cannot be disabled, unlike the cache feature which can be controlled.
So disabling the caches will not solve all the self-modifying code 
problems.</p>

<p>On a 68000, this code will work properly:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.b  #1,moveinst+2
        nop
moveinst:
        move.b  #0,D0
        ...</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>The value in D0 will be 1 (self-modifying code).</p>

<p>On a 68020 this still seems to work, at least the first time, and all 
the time if you disable the instruction cache.</p>

<p>On a 68060, this code will not work (D0 will be equal to 0!!) whether the 
caches are on or off. This can be harmless but can also lead to strange 
behaviour if the instruction dynamically modified is a branch!</p>

<p>In this case there's no other way than patching the code 'by hand', by 
breaking the instruction flow (e.g by a TRAP or a BSR.B).</p>

<p>Hint: Coders insert NOPs in the code like the example above to be sure 
prefetch will be knocked out on a 68000. Search for NOPs in the code, 
and you'll be surprised to find interesting things like CPU dependent 
loops, prefetch and cracked software :)</p>

<p>Most of the Readysoft games have the equivalent of this routine in their
bootblock:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        lea     _Fetch(pc),a0
        ...
_Fetch  clr.l   (a0)+               ;2 bytes (long word aligned)
        addq.l  #8,d0               ;2 bytes</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>All Amigas will fetch both instructions in one hit, even though both
lines of code will be eliminated. However, a number of emulators (eg. Fellow)
will wipe out the 2nd instruction and cause the add line to be interpreted
as something else, eventually causing the game to crash. Hence, no uncracked 
Readysoft games will work on emulators! (There are many more problems aswell,
sigh!)</p>


<h4><a name="DodgyCode">Dodgy Code</a></h4>

<p>Sometimes you have to wonder how people who write software ever managed
to create a program which runs. Check out the following code from an old
Oracle intro:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.l  #4,a0
        move.l  (a0),a0
        move.l  (a0),a6
        ...proceed to use a6 as GfxBase...</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>How often will GfxBase happen to be the 2nd library down the chain?
Another classic example is from the game Final Blow, cracked by Crystal.
Their intro is a standard AmigaDos executable program and the bootblock
decides to load it at $40000 and then jsr $40000. Slight problem. The
AmigaDos hunks are the first $20 odd bytes. It's a miracle this code
ever ran at all!</p>
		

<h4><a name="Protection">Disk based protection</a></h4>

<p>Surprisingly enough, most games will not work on non 68000 computers due 
to shitty disk based protection and dodgy loaders! Often the game itself 
is reasonably well written and would have worked had the disk format been
standard. For example, Rob Northen Copylock v1.0 fails on anything higher 
than a 68010, so many old (original) games will not work!</p>

<p>Remove the protection and you will often get the game working! Contact
your local cracker!</p>


<h4><a name="FaultyMemoryDetection">Faulty Memory Detection</a></h4>

<p>A problem encountered sometimes is a faulty chip memory detection because 
of the "unexpected" fact that AGA amigas have got 2MB of chip
memory. (Programmers should not assume anything about memory on a computer
but often do!)</p>

<p>Some games try to find fast memory at $200000:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.l  #$aaaaaaaa,$200000  ;Poke in $200000
        cmp.l   #$aaaaaaaa,$200000  ;Re-read to check valid address
        bne     NoFastAt200000
        ...</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>This detection works provided the chipmem size does not exceed 1Mb 
($0 to $FFFFF). With an AGA Amiga like the A1200, chip memory can be 
found from $0 to $1FFFFF.</p>

<p>When you poke in $200000 on a A1200 without fastmem at $200000, there 
is a mirror effect and the write address is decoded as $0. So, the re-read 
is OK, and the game trusts that there is at least 512K of memory from 
$200000 to $27FFFF. It actually stores the data from $0 to $7FFFF and it 
crashes very efficiently, as program code and stack are in that zone 99% 
of the time.</p>

<p>The "safe" thing to do would have been:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>       move.l   #0,$0
       move.l   #$aaaaaaaa,$200000  ;Poke in $200000
       cmp.l    #$aaaaaaaa,$200000  ;Re-read to check valid address
       bne      NoFastAt200000
       cmp.l    $0,$200000          ;Test the mirror effect
       beq      NoFastAt200000</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>The mirror or modulo effect is detected. This error was found and corrected 
by Jean François Fabre in Lotus Turbo Challenge 2 and 3, from 
Gremlin.</p>


<h4><a name="Freezes">Freezes on keypresses</a></h4>

<p>Some games work fine until you press a key. Then it freezes and you're 
forced to reboot. But the music is still playing, and some animation can 
continue!</p>

<p>That sounds strange and it is! Keyboard interrupts have got a priority 
level of 2, while VBL interrupts (often used by tracker routines) have 
a level of 3. Which explains that the music can continue playing. The
keyboard interrupt was not acknowledged, and it happens all the time. The
program can't continue. Only higher interrupts can run.</p>

<p>This is often caused by an acknowledge too soon before the rte:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>KbInt:  move.w  #8,$dff09c      ;Acknowledge interrupt
        ...
        ...
        rte</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>Moving the acknowledge instruction just before the rte can be enough.
If this does not work, try replacing #8 by #$7FFF.</p>

<p>Interrupt 3 can behave the same way too. Use the same solution (try #$70 
before trying #$7FFF).</p>

<p>These problems were noticed (and fixed) in Ninja Spirit, R-Type 2 and 
Z-Out!</p>


<h4><a name="KeyboardInt">Keyboard Interrupts</a></h4>

<p>Keyboard routines are usually setup to run from the level 2 interrupt.
When a keypress is detected, the level 2 interrupt is fired.
Between detecting the key and acknowledging the keypress, there needs
to be a time delay. The ways to achieve this are (ranked from best to
worst):</p>

<ol>
<li>CIA Timer
</li><li>Raster positioning
</li><li>A CPU Loop
</li></ol>

<p>The CIA timer is virtually never used in (older) games, and the raster
positioning method is hardly ever found.  Most games resort to a stupid
loop like this between detecting and acknowledging the keypress:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.b  $bfec01,d0      ; Keypress
        not.b   d0
        ror.b   #1,d0           ; d0 now contains the raw key
dump    moveq   #36,d1
loop    dbf     d1,loop         ; Stupid loop</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>The problem with this is that faster CPU's make the loop almost non
existant, and the keypress is not acknowledged. The computer then locks
up. The easiest fix is to steal 6 bytes from the code, and insert a
jsr to some patch code which has a working delay:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        lea     .KBFix(pc),a0       ;Your keyboard fix routine
        move.w  #$4e79,dumb         ;Insert JSR
        move.l  a0,loop

        ...

.KBFix  movem.l d0-d1/a0,-(sp)      ;Horizontal raster timing code
        lea     (_custom+vhposr),a0
        moveq   #3-1,d0             ;Wait because handshake min 75µs
.1      move.b  (a0),d1
.2      cmp.b   (a0),d1             ;One line is 63.5µs
        beq.b   .2
        dbf     d0,.1               ;Min=127µs Max=190.5µs
        movem.l (sp)+,d0-d1/a0
.RTS    rts                         ;Back to original code</tt></pre><p></p>


<h4><a name="Movem">Movem instruction</a></h4>

<p>The following movem command yields different results when run on a 
68000/010 and a 68020/030/040/060:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        movem.x rl,-(an)</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>There is a difference if the register used in predecrement mode is also 
contained in the register list. For the 68020, 68030 and 68040 the value 
written to memory is the initial register value decemented by the size of
the operation. The 68000 and 68010 write the initial register value 
(not decremented).</p>

<p>Because this type of construction is not very useful, no problems to 
existing software are known.</p>


<h4><a name="MoveP">MoveP instruction</a></h4>

<p>The MoveP (Move to/from Peripheral) instruction moves word or longword
data between a data register and alternate bytes of memory. This instruction
is intended to interface to 8-bit peripherals connected to either the high 
byte or the low byte of the data bus. The only time it will save you much
work is when you have a peripheral device, for example a math processor, with
a multiple-byte internal register that's memory mapped externally. In other
words, not too often.</p>

<p>The memory address is specified using address register indirect with
displacement notation.</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        movep   Dn,d(An)            ;Assembler syntax
        movep   D(An),Dn

        movep.l d0,0(a0)            ;Opcode $01c80000
        movep.w 0(a0),d0            ;Opcode $01080000</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>You maybe wondering why we care about this instruction. The reason is the
68060 no longer has this instruction, so any software which uses it crashes
on these CPU's! However, fixing it is pretty easy, here are a few examples:</p>

<p>In the game E-Motion from The Assembly Line:

</p><p></p><pre><tt>        movep.w (-1,a1),d0</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>To fix this, you need to change the instruction to run the following code:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.b  (-1,a1),d0
        lsl.w   #8,d0
        move.b  (1,a1),d0</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>In the game Speedball 2, the following code is found:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.l  (a0)+,d0 
        movep.l d0,(1,a1) 
        move.l  (a0)+,d0
        movep.l d0,(9,a1)</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>To fix this, you need to change the code to:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.l  (a0),d0             ;Not really needed
        move.b  (a0)+,(1,a1) 
        move.b  (a0)+,(3,a1)
        move.b  (a0)+,(5,a1)
        move.b  (a0)+,(7,a1)
        move.l  (a0),d0
        move.b  (a0)+,(9,a1)
        move.b  (a0)+,(11,a1)
        move.b  (a0)+,(13,a1)
        move.b  (a0)+,(15,a1)</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>The first and 5th lines of fix code are not strictly necessary as the
game proceeds to destroy d0 anyway, but the above code is at least a 
perfect emulation of the 4 lines of original instructions.</p>

<p>The movep command does not affect any condition flags, and is usually 4 
bytes long, so you cannot simply put a jsr routine over the top of the code
as that requires 6 bytes. You may need to use traps, a 16 bit displacement 
jsr or modifying the previous or following instruction to steal the extra
2 bytes you need.</p>


<h4><a name="SelfModifyingCode">Self Modifying Code</a></h4>

<p>This is a major problem found in a surprisingly large number of games,
including several reasonably new ones. Basically the programmers write code
which modifies itself while it is running. As more efficient CPU's came out, 
they had caches on them which store the last few instructions executed. When 
the code modified itself, it modified only the copy in memory and not the 
one in the cache. The next few instructions in the cache will be rubbish
because the game expected to decrypt the next few instructions. Shortly after
the game will crash!</p>

<p>In the old days, crackers just used to save the decrypted file over the
game and make it jump into the code partway through it. That way the decryption
phase has already happened and the code will run on all CPU's. The more elegant
way to fix this is to emulate the decryption instructions yourself which operate
on the data in real memory and once it has fully decrypted you can clear the
cache and execute the game code.</p>


<h4><a name="StackFrames">Stackframes are different on each processor</a></h4>

<p>The stackframes created by the processor on interrupts and exceptions 
are different for the members of the 68k family. On the 68000 a stackframe 
is 6 bytes, except on Bus and Address Error. The stackframe contains
first the saved SR at (a7) and the saved PC at (2,a7). On all other 
processors (68010+) the minimal stackframe is 8 bytes and additionally
contains the vector number as word at (6,a7). This Four-Word stackframe
format $0 is created for "Trap #xx" and Interrupts on 68010-68060. 
The stackframes on other exceptions are different on each processor.</p>

<p>The RTE instruction works differently on the 68000 against 68010+. On a 
68000 it simply writes the SR and PC back and continues program execution 
at the interrupted address. On the 68010+ it additionally frees the
stackframe depending on the stackframe format.</p>

<p>Some programs push an address (PC) and a SR and then execute an RTE 
instruction. This works on a 68000 only, but on 68010+ this will have 
undefinable results.</p>

<p>For example, the Ben Daglish music replay routine creates a stack frame
and calls rte. This was probably seen in it's day as some nice code as it 
sets the SR back to the what it was originally and returns back to the code.
However, this code bombs on 68010+ processors:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        lea     $dff000,a6
        move.w  sr,-(sp)            ;Save SR onto the stack
        ori.w   #$700,sr
        ...
        move.w  #2,6(a1)
        rte</tt></pre><p></p>
		
<p>The code above originally worked because the game already had the return
address on the stack, so by placing the SR also on the stack, it created a
valid 68000 stackframe. The easiest fix for this code is to nop out the
SR code and change the rte to an rts:</p>
		
<p></p><pre><tt>        lea     $dff000,a6
        nop                         ;move.w  sr,-(sp)
        nop                         ;ori.w   #$700,sr
        nop
        ...
        move.w  #2,6(a1)
        rts                         ;rte</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>You could also fix it with the following code:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        lea     $dff000,a6
        move.w  sr,-(sp)
        ori.w   #$700,sr
        ...
        move.w  #2,6(a1)
        move.w  (sp)+,sr            ;Restore the SR
        rts                         ;RTS instead of RTE</tt></pre><p></p>
		
<p>You can search for the opcodes $40e7007c700 to detect the Ben Daglish
replayer. The bug exists in Artura, Axel's Magic Hammer, Deflektor, Federation
of Free Traders, H.A.T.E., Super Cars, Switchblade and probably many more!</p>
		
<p>If a program contains dodgy stack frame code, you have to emulate it. 
Sometimes it may be enough to replace the rte with an rtr.</p>

<p>Another way is to make the stackframe independent from the type of processor 
by using a TRAP (the JSR equivalent of RTE).</p>


<h4><a name="StatusRegister">Status Register</a></h4>

<p>Some games insert strange values into the status register which cause the game
to crash on non 68000 machines. For example, in the game Defender 2 by Jeff 
Minter/Arc, the following code was found:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.w  #$78ff,sr           ;Crashes on most CPU's</tt></pre><p></p>

<p>Try inserting "normal" values for the SR if you find problems. In
this case, a normal supervisor mode value of $2000 does the trick and allows the
game to run:</p>

<p></p><pre><tt>        move.w  #$2000,sr           ;SR fixed!</tt></pre><p></p>


<h4><a name="VBR">VBR (Vector Base Register)</a></h4>

<p>All 680x0 machines have a 1K "exception table" starting at address $0 when
the machine first boots.  This can subsequently be moved into another area
on 010's and higher using the Vector Base Register (VBR) and a simple copy
loop.</p>

<p>Assuming it's located at $0, then $0 - $ff is where the main action's at,
on all 68k machines.  The address range $100 - $3ff is reserved by Motorola
for "user vectors".  This address space is unused on the Amiga, 
but might be used on other machines.  The point is that $0 - $ff are the 
important vectors on all 68k machines, and $100 - $3ff *might* also be used, 
or then again, might not be.</p>


<h4><a name="WeirdROMAccesses">Weird ROM Accesses</a></h4>

<p>Some games rely on some values in ROM to work properly. For example, the
great game "Gods" works OK from OS1.3 to OS3.0, but fails
on OS3.1 on the same computer! It works OK with a softkicked OS3.0, but
fails with a OS3.1 chip!)</p>

<p>The solution: the game reads in $FFxxxx (I don't remember now) and I really 
don't know why. By luck, it worked until OS3.0 but the game seems not to 
like the values returned by OS3.1!</p>

<p>Some other games even call ROM addresses directly (Gravity Force) or poke in 
non documented exec strucures, copperlists...</p>

<p>A possible explanation of those accesses in non-DOS games is a protection 
against hardware freezers like Action Replay or Nordic Power.</p>

<p>Another example: There is a check in $F00000 for the value $1111 in the game
Pinball Dreams, maybe to detect such a device but:</p>

<ol>
<li>It does not detect an Action Replay III cartridge.
</li><li>It will detect a Blizzard 1260 card and crash!
</li></ol>

<p>If you find routines looking like this, remove them, or it may cause problems 
to other users of your patches. For the moment, the solution is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Look.
</li><li>Get a good value (using a 1.3 kick, and/or another Amiga).
</li><li>Remove.
</li><li>Imitate.
</li></ol>
