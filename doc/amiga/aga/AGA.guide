@node summary


1. Summary of new features for AA
---------------------------------

32 bit wide data bus supports input of 32-bit wide bitplane data and allows
doubling of memory bandwidth. Additional doubling of bandwidth can be
achieved by using FAST page mode Ram. The same bandwidth enhancements are
available for sprites. Also the maximum number of bitplanes useable in all
modes was increased to eight (8).

The color Palette has been expanded to 256 colors deep and 25 bits wide (8
RED,8 GREEN,8 BLUE,1 GENLOCK). This permits display of 256
simultaneous colors in all resolutions. A palette of 16,777,216 colors are
available in all resolutions.

28Mhz clock input allows for cleaner definition of HIRES and SHRES pixels
ALICE`S clock genarator is synchronized by means of LISA`s 14MHz and SCLK
outputs, Genlock XCLK and XCLKEN pins have been eliminated (external MUX is
now required).

A new register bit allows sprites to appear in the screen border regions
(BRDRSPRT - See @{"BPLCON3" link BPLCON3}).

A bitplane mask field of 8 bits allows an address offset into the color
palette.
Two 4-bit mask fields do the same for odd and even sprites.

In Dual Playfield modes,2 4-bitplane playfields are now possible in all
resolutions.

Two Extra high-order playfield scrollbits allow seamless scrolling of up to
64 bit wide bitplanes in all resolutions. Resolution of bitplane scroll,
display window,and horizontal sprite position has been improved to 35ns in
all resolutions.

A new 8-bitplane HAM mode has been created, 6 for colors and 2 for control
bits. All HAM modes are available in all resolutions (not just LORES as
before).

A RST_input pin has been added, which resets all the bits contained in
registers that were new for ECS or LISA:
@{"BPLCON3" link BPLTCON3}, @{"BPLCON4" link BPLCON4}, @{"CLXCON2" link CLXCON2}, @{"DIWHIGH" link }, @{"FMODE" link FMODE}.

Sprite resolution can be set to LORES,HIRES,SHRES,independant of bitplane
resolution.

Attached Sprites are now available in all resolutions.

Hardware Scan Doubling support has been added for bitplanes and sprites.
This is intended to allow 15KHz screens to be intelligently displayed on a
31KHz monitor and share the display with 31KHz screens.

2. Explanation of new features
------------------------------

Bitplanes
---------

There are now 8 bitplanes instead of 6. In single playfield modes they can
address 256 colors instead of 64. As long as the memory architecture can
support the bandwidth, all 8 bitplanes are available in all 3 resolutions
In the same vein, 4+4 bitplane dualplayfield is available in all 3
resolutions, unless bitplane scan-doubling is enabled, in which case
both playfields share the same bitplane modulus register. Bits 15 thru 8 of
@{"BPLCON4" link BPLCON4} comprise an 8 bit mask for the 8 bitplane address, XOR`ing the
individual bits. This allows the copper to exchange color maps with a
single instruction.

@{"BPLCON1" link BPLCON1} now contains an 8 bit scroll value for each of the playfields.
Granularity of scroll now extends down to 35nSec.(1 SHRES pixel), and
scroll can delay playfield thru 32 bus cycles. Bits BPAGEM and BPL32
in new register @{"FMODE" link FMODE} control size of bitplane data in @{"BPL1DAT" link BPLxDAT} thru @{"BPL8DAT" link BPLxDAT}.

The old 6 bitplane HAM mode, unlike before, works in HIRES and SHRES
resolutions.

As before bitplanes 5 and 6 control it`s function as follows:

        +-----+-----+--------+--------+------------------+
        | BP6 | BP5 |   RED  |  GREEN | BLUE             |
        +-----+-----+--------+--------+------------------+
        | 0   | 0   | select new base register (1 of 16) |
        +-----+-----+--------+--------+------------------+
        | 0   | 1   |  hold  |  hold  | modify           |
        +-----+-----+--------+--------+------------------+
        | 1   | 0   | modify |  hold  |  hold            |
        +-----+-----+--------+--------+------------------+
        | 1   | 1   |  hold  | modify |  hold            |
        +-----+-----+--------+--------+------------------+

There is a new 8 bitplane HAM (Hold and Modify) mode. This mode is invoked
when BPU field in @{"BPLCON0" link BPLCON0} is set to 8 , and HAMEN is set. Bitplanes 1 and 2
are used as control bits analagous to the function of bitplanes 5 and 6 in
6 bitplane HAM mode:

        +-----+-----+--------+--------+------------------+
        | BP2 | BP1 |   RED  |  GREEN | BLUE             |
        +-----+-----+--------+--------+------------------+
        | 0   | 1   | select new base register (1 of 64) |
        +-----+-----+--------+--------+------------------+
        | 0   | 1   |  hold  |  hold  | modify           |
        +-----+-----+--------+--------+------------------+
        | 1   | 0   | modify |  hold  |  hold            |
        +-----+-----+--------+--------+------------------+
        | 1   | 1   |  hold  | modify |  hold            |
        +-----+-----+--------+--------+------------------+

Since only 6 bitplanes are available for modify data, the data is placed in
6 MSB. The 2 LSB are left unmodified, which allows creation of all
16,777,216 colors simultaneously, assuming one had a large enough screen
and picked one`s base registers judiciously. This HAM mode also works in
HIRES and SHRES modes.

For compatibility reasons EHB mode remains intact. Its existence is rather
moot in that we have more than enough colors in the color table to replace
its functionality. As before, EHB is invoked whenever SHRES = HIRES =
HAMEN= DPF = 0 and BPU = 6. Please note that starting with ECS DENISE
there is a bit in @{"BPLCON2" link BPLCON2} which disables this mode (KILLEHB).

Bits PF2OF2,1,0 in @{"BPLCON3" link BPLCON3} determine second playfield`s offset into the
color table. This is now necessary since playfields in DPF mode can have up
to 4 bitplanes. Offset value are as defined in register map.

BSCAN2 bit in @{"FMODE" link FMODE} enables bitplane scan-doubling. When V0 bit of @{"DIWSTRT" link DIWSTRT}
matches V0 of vertical beam counter, @{"BPL1MOD" link BPL1MOD} contains the modulus for the
display line, else @{"BPL2MOD" link BPL2MOD} is used. When scan-doubled both odd and even
bitplanes use the same modulus on a given line, whereas in normal mode odd
bitplanes used BPL1MOD and even bitplanes used BPL2MOD. As a result Dual
Playfields screens will probably not display correctly when scan-doubled.

Sprites
-------

Bits SPAGEM and SPR32 in @{"FMODE" link FMODE} whether size of sprite load datain
@{"SPR0DATA(B)" link SPRxDAT} thru @{"SPR7DATA(B)" link SPRxDAT} is 16,32, or 64 bits, analagous to bitplanes.
@{"BPLCON3" link BPLCON3} contains several bits relating to sprite behavior. SPRES1 and
SPRES0 control sprite resolution, whether they conform to theECS standard
or override tp LORES,HIRES,or SHRES. BRDRSPRT, when high,allows sprites to
be visible in border areas. ESPRM7 thru ESPRM4 allow relocation of the even
sprite color map. OSPRM7 thru OSPRN4 allow relocation of the odd sprite
color map. In the case of attached sprites OSPRM bits are used.

SSCAN2 bit in @{"FMODE" link FMODE} enables sprite scan-doubling. When enabled, individual
SH10 bits in SPRxPOS registers control whether or not a given sprite is to
be scan-doubled. When V0 bit of @{"SPRxPOS" link SPRxPOS} register matches V0 bit of vertical
beam counter, the given sprite`s DMA is allowed to proceed as before. If
the don`t match, then sprite DMA is disabled and LISA reuses the sprite
 data
from the previous line. When sprites are scan-doubled, only the position
and control registers need be modified by the programmer; the data
registers need no modification.

NOTE: Sprite vertical start and stop positions must be of the same parity,
i.e. both odd or even.

Compatibility
-------------

RST_pin resets all bits in all registers new to AA. These registers include:
@{"BPLCON3" link BPLCON3}, @{"BPLCON4" link BPLCON4}, @{"CLXCON2" link CLXCON2}, @{"DIWHIGH" link DIWHIGH}, @{"FMODE" link FMODE}.

ECSENA bit (formerly ENBPLCN3) is used to disable those register bits in
BPLCON3 that are never accessed by old copper lists, and in addition are
required by old style copper lists to be in their default
settings.Specifically ECSENA forces the following bits to their default low
settings: BRDRBLNK, BRDNTRAN, ZDCLKEN, EXTBLKEN, and BRDRSPRT.

CLXCON2 is reset by a write to CLXCON, so that old game programs will be
able to correctly detect collisions.

@{"DIWHIGH" link DIWHIGH} is reset by writes to @{"DIWSTRT" link DIWSTRT} or @{"DIWSTOP" link DIWSTRT}. This is interlock is
inhertied from ECS Denise.

Genlock
-------

Lots of new genlock features were added to ECS DENISE and arecarried over
to LISA. ZDBPEN in @{"BPLCON2" link BPLCON2} allows any bitplane, selected by ZDBPSEL2,1,0,to
be used as a transparency mask (ZD pin mirrors contents of selected
bitplane). ZDCTEN disables the old @{"COLOR00" link COLORx} is transparent mode, and allows
the bit31 position of each color in the color table to control
transparency.ZDCLKEN generates a 14MHz clock synchronized with the video
data that can be used by video post-processors. Finally, BRDNTRAN in
@{"BPLCON3" link BPLCON3} generates an opaque border region which can be used to frame live
video.

Color Lookup Table
------------------

The color table has grown from 32 13-bit registers to 256 25-bit registers.
Several new register bits have been added to @{"BPLCON3" link BPLCON3} to facilitate loading
the table with only 32 register addresses. LOCT, selects either the 16 MSB
or LSB for loading. Loading the MSB always loads the LSB as well for
compatibility, so when 24 bit colors are desired load LSB after MSB.
BANK2,1,0 of 8 32 address banks for loading as follows:

        +-------+-------+-------+----------------------+
        | BANK2 | BANK1 | BANK0 | COLOR ADDRESS RANGE  |
        +-------+-------+-------+----------------------+
        |  0    |   0   |   0   |  @{"COLOR00" link COLORx} - COLOR1F   |
        |  0    |   0   |   1   |  COLOR20 - COLOR3F   |
        |  0    |   1   |   0   |  COLOR40 - COLOR5F   |
        |  0    |   1   |   1   |  COLOR60 - COLOR7F   |
        |  1    |   0   |   0   |  COLOR80 - COLOR9F   |
        |  1    |   0   |   1   |  COLORA0 - COLORBF   |
        |  1    |   1   |   0   |  COLORC0 - COLORDF   |
        |  1    |   1   |   1   |  COLORE0 - COLORFF   |
        +-------+-------+-------+----------------------+

RDRAM bit in @{"BPLCON2" link BPLCON2} causes LISA to interpret all color table accesses as
reads.
Note: There is no longer any need to "scramble" SHRES color table entries.
This artifice is no longer required and pepole who bypass ECS graphics
library calls to do their own 28MHz graphics are to be pointed at and
publicly humiliated.

Collision
---------

A new register @{"CLXCON2" link CLXCON2} contains 4 new bits. ENBP7 and ENBP6 are the enable
bits for bitplanes 7 and 8, respectively. Similarly, MVBP7 and MPBP8 are
their match value bits. @{"CLXDAT" link CLXDAT} is unchanged.

Horizontal Comparators
----------------------

All programmable comparators with the exception of @{"VHPOSW" link VHPOSW} have 35nSec
resolution.: @{"DIWHIGH" link DIWHIGH}, @{"HBSTOP" link HBSTOP}, @{"SPRCTL" link SPRCTL}, @{"BPLCON1" link BPLCON1}. BPLCON1 has additional
high-order bits as well. Note that horizontal bit position representing
140nSec resolution has been changed to 3rd least significant bit,where
before it used to be a field`s LSB, For example, bit 00 in BPLCON1 used to
be named PF1H0 and now it`s called PF1H2.

Coercion of 15KHz to 31KHz:
---------------------------

We have added new hardware features to LISA to aid in properly displaying
15KHz and 31KHz viewports together on the same 31KHz display. LISA can
globally set sprite resolution to LORES, HIRES, or SHRES.
LISA will ignore SH10 compare bits in @{"SPRxPOS" link SPRxPOS} when scan-doubling, thereby
allowing ALICE to use these bits individually set scan-doubling.

3. List of registers ordered by address
---------------------------------------

Symbols Used:

& = Register used by DMA channel only.
% = Register used by DMA channel usually, processors sometimes.
+ = Address register pair. Low word uses DB1-DB15, High word DB0-DB4.
~ = Address not writable by the coprocessor unless @{"COPCON" link COPCON} bit 1 is set true
h = new for HiRes chip set.
p = new for IAA chip set.
A = Agnus/Alice chip set.
D = Denise/Lisa chip set.
P = Paula chip.
W = Write.
R = Read.
ER= Early read. This is a DMA transfer to RAM, from either the disk or from
    the blitter. Ram timing requires data to be on the bus earlier than
    microprocessor read cycles. These transfers are therefore initiated by
    Agnus timing, rather than a read address on the register address bus
    (RGA).
S = Strobe (Write address with no register bits).
PTL,PTH = 20 bit pointer that addresses DMA data. Must be reloaded by a
    processor before use (Vertical blank for bit plane and sprite pointers.
    and prior to starting the blitter for blitter pointers). (old chips -
    18 bits).
LCL,LCH = 20 bit location (starting address) of DMAdata. Used to
    automatically restart pointers. such as the Coprocessor program counter
    (during vertical blank), and the audio sample counter (whenever the
    audio lentgh count is finished), (Old chips - 18 bits).
MOD = 15 bit Modulo. A number that is automatically added to the memory
    address at the end of each line to generate the address for the
    beginning of the next line. This allows the blitter (or the display
    window) to operate on (or display) a window of data that is smaller
    than the actual picture in memory. (memory map) Uses 15 bits, plus
    sign extended.

HARDDIS = This bit is used to disable the hardwire vertical horizontal
          window limits. It is cleared upon reset.

LPENDIS = When this bit is a low and LPE (@{"BPLCON0" link BPLCON0},BIT 3) is enabled, the
          light-pen latched value(beam hit position) will be read by
          @{"VHPOSR" link VHPOSR}, @{"VPOSR" link VPOSR} and @{"HHPOSR" link HHPOSR}. When
          the bit is a high the light-pen latched value is ignored and
          the actual beam counter position is read by VHPOSR, VPOSR, and
          HHPOSR.

VARVBEN = Use the comparator generated vertical blank (from @{"VBSTRT" link VBSTOP}, @{"VBSTOP" link VBSTOP})           
          to run the internal chip stuff-sending RGA signals to Denise,
          starting sprites,resetting light pen. It also disables the hard
          stop on the vertical display window.

LOLDIS  = Disable long line/short toggle. This is useful for DUAL mode
          where even multiples are wanted, or in any single display
          where this toggling is not desired.

CSCBEN  = The variable composite sync comes out on the HSY pin, and the
          variable conosite blank comes out on the VSY pin. The idea is
          to allow all the information to come out of the chip for a
          DUAL mode display. The normal monitor uses the normal composite
          sync, and the variable composite sync &blank come out the HSY &
          VSY pins. The bits VARVSTEN & VARHSYEN (below) have priority over
          this control bit.

VARVSYEN= Comparator VSY -> VSY pin. The variable VSY is set vertically on
          @{"VSSTRT" link HSSTRT}, reset vertically on @{"VSSTOP" link VSSTOP}, with the horizontal position
          for set set & reset @{"HSSTRT" link HSSTRT} on short fields (all fields are short
          if LACE = 0) and @{"HCENTER" link HCENTER} on long fields (every other field if
          LACE = 1).

VARHSYEN= Comparator HSY -> HSY pin. Set on HSSTRT value, reset on @{"HSSTOP" link HSSTOP}
          value.

VARBEAMEN=Enables the variable beam counter comparators to operate
          (allowing diffrent beam counter total values) on the main horiz
          counter. It also disables hard display stops on both horizontal
          and vertical.

DUAL    = Run the horizontal comparators with the alternate horizontal beam
          counter, and starts the UHRES pointer chain with the reset of
          this counter rather than the normal one. This allows the UHRES
          pointers to come out more than once in a horizontal line,
          assuming there is some memory bandwidth left (it doesn`t work in
          640*400*4 interlace mode) also, to keep the two displays synced,
          the horizontal line lentghs should be multiples of each other.
          If you are amazingly clever, you might not need to do this.

PAL     = Set appropriate decodes (in normal mode) for PAL. In variable
          beam counter mode this bit disables the long line/short line
          toggle- ends up short line.

VARCSYEN= Enables CSY from the variable decoders to come out the CSY
          (VARCSY is set on @{"HSSTRT" link HSSTRT} match always, and also on @{"HCENTER" link HCENTER}
          match when in vertical sync. It is reset on @{"HSSTOP" link HSSTOP} match when VSY
          and on both @{"HBSTRT" link HBSTOP} & @{"HBSTOP" link HBSTOP} matches during VSY. A reasonable
          composite can be generated by setting HCENTER half a horiz line
          from @{"HSSTRT" link HSSTRT}, and HBSTOP at (HSSTOP-HSSTRT) before HCENTER, with
          HBSTRT at (HSSTOP-HSSTRT) before HSSTRT.
          HSYTRUE, VSYTRUE, CSYTRUE = These change the polarity of the
          HSY*, VSY*, & CSY* pins to HSY, VSY, & CSY respectively for
          input & output.

         These registers contain the modulos for the odd and
         even bit planes. A modulo is a number that is automa-
         itcally added to the address at the end of each line,
         in order that the address then points to the start of
         the next line. Since they have seperate modulos, the
         odd and even bit planes may have sizes that are
         different from each other, as well as different from
         the display window size.
         If scan-doubling is enabled, BPL1MOD serves as the
         primary bitplane modulos and BPL2MOD serves as the
         alternate. Lines whose LSBs of beam counter and @{"DIWSTRT" link DIWSTRT}
         match are designated primary, whereas lines whose LSBs
         don`t match are designated alternate.

COLORxx  180-1BE  W       COLOR table xx

         There 32 of these registers (xx=00-31) and together with the banking
         bits they address the 256 locations in the color palette. There are
         actually two sets of color regs, selection of which is controlled by
         the LOCT reg bit. When LOCT = 0 the 4 MSB of red, green and blue
         video data are selected along with the T bit for genlocks the low
         order set of registers is also selected as well, so that the 4 bits-
         values are automatically extended to 8 bits.This provides
         compatibility with old software. If the full range of palette values
         are desired, then LOCT can be set high and independant values for
         the 4 LSB of red, green  and blue can be written. The low order
         color registers do not contain a transparency (T) bit.

         The table below shows the color register bit usage.

         This is a dummy address that is generated by the coprocessor whenever
         it is loading instructions into its own instruction register.
         This actually occurs every coprocessor cycle except for the second
         (IR2) cycle of the MOVE instruction. The three types of instructions
         are shown below.

         MOVE: Move immediate to dest

         WAIT: Wait until beam counter is equal to, or greater than.
               (Keeps coprocessor off of bus until beam position has
               been reached)

         SKIP: Skip if beam counter is equal to, or greater than.
               (Skips following MOVE inst. unless beam position has been
               reached)

         IR1=First instruction register
         IR2=Second insturction register
         DA =Destination address for MOVE instruction.Fetched during
             IR1 time,used during IR2 time on RGA bus.
         RD =RAM Data moved by MOVE instruction at IR2 time
             directly from RAM to the address given by the DA field.
         VP =Vertical beam position comparison bit.
         HP =Horizontal beam position comparison bit.
         VE =Enable comparison (mask bit)
         HE =Enable comparison (mask bit)

 * Note: BFD = Blitter finished disable. When this bit is true, the blitter
               finished flag will have no effect on the coprocessor. When this
               bit is zero the blitter finished flag must be true (in addition
               to the rest of the bit comparisons) before the coprocessor can
               exit from it`s wait state, or skip over an instruction. Note
               that the V7 comparison cannot be masked.

         The coprocessor is basically a 2 cycle machine that requests
         the bus only during odd memory cycles. (4 memory cycles per in)

         It has priority over the blitter and micro.

         There are only three types of instructions, MOVE immediate,
         WAIT until ,and SKIP if. All instructions require 2 bus cycles
         (and two instruction words).Since only the odd bus cycles are
         requested, 4 memory cycle times are required per instruction.
         (memory cycles are 280 ns)

         There are two indirect jump registers @{"COP1LC" link COP1LCH} and @{"COP2LC" link COP1LCH}.
         These are 20 bit pointer registers whose contents are used to modify
         program counter for initalization or jumps.

         They are transfered to the program counter whenever strobe address
         @{"COPJMP1" link COPJMP1} or @{"COPJMP2" link COPJMP2} are written.In addition COP1LC is automatically
         used at the beginning of each vertical blank time.

         It is important that one of the jump registers be initalized and it`s
         jump strobe address hit, after power up but before coprocessor DMA is
         initalized.T his insures a determined startup address, and state.

	These registers buffer the sprite image data.They are
	usually loaded by the sprite DMA channel but may be
	loaded by either processor at any time. When a horizontal
	coincidence occurs the buffers are dumped into shift
	registers and serially outputed to the display, MSB first
	on the left.
	NOTE: Writing to the A buffer enables (arms) the sprite.
	Writing to the SPRxCTL registers disables the sprite.
	If enabled, data in the A and B buffers will be output
	whenever the beam counter equals the sprite horizontal
	position value in the SPRxPOS register. In lowres mode,
	1 sprite pixel is 1 bitplane pixel wide.In HRES and
	SHRES mode, 1 sprite pixel is 2 bitplane pixels.
	The DATB bits are the 2SBs (worth 2) for the color registers,
	and MSB for SHRES. DATA bits are LSBs of the pixels.

Sprites
-------

All sprites can now be displayed in either:

1) ECS default mode
2) 140 ns (this is not ECS mode!)
3) 70 ns
4) 35 ns

on display resolution. eg 35 ns sprites on a lores screen, or 140 ns
sprites on a superhires screen.

Sprites are either 16, 32, or 64 bits wide.

Sprites can be attatched in any mode (formerly could not attach sprites
in the ECS SHRES 35ns resolution mode).

Can use any bank of 16 colours from the 256 colour palette for the sprite
colours.

Key:

 ! needs 1x Bandwidth (old modes)
 @ needs 2x Bandwidth (normal CAS 32bit bus with or double CAS 16 bit bus width)
 $ needs 4x Bandwidth (double CAS 32bit bus width)
