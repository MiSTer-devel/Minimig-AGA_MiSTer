2005-04-13 - DW - MINIMIG      - _foe and _loe are now made with clocks driving FF's, sram_bridge now also gets .clk(clk)
2005-04-11 - DW - MINIMIG      - adapted top to cleaned up address decoder, connected cia's to .clk(~qclk) and .tick(e) for testing
2005-04-11 - DW - CIA          - removed rd again due to change in address decoder, better reset behaviour for timer D
2005-04-11 - DW - AGNUS        - removed rd,hwr and lwr signals due to change in address decoder
2005-04-10 - DW - MINIMIG      - added cia's, verified timers a/b and I/O ports
2005-04-10 - DW - CIA          - added clock synchronisation latch on input ports, added rd (read) input to detect valid bus states
