IMPORTANT - AGA CHIPSET stuff
- increment hpos counter in denise by two LSB bits (35ns counter)
- hdiwstrt & hdiwstop (HDIWHIGH) also have two new high-resolution bits
- actually, all (horizontal) comparators in AGA chipset have 35ns resolution

- bitplane shifter problems 
  * more 'undocumented' stuff ... (looks like the output shifter is actually 256 bit to allow 64-pixel fetches in lowres to be shifted on shres resolution - implemented)
  * upper is probably wrong, shifter is 64bits plus additional shres shifter (two bits?)
  * even that bitplane shifter is probably wrong: http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=71437
  * check if shifter problems are the cause of minimig display shifted to the right too much in some cases (how is shres scrolling supposed to work - what to do if those bits are set to 0??)
- bitplane DMA register delays (TLC - PowerTrax demo, hint by Toni Wilen):
  * Writing to BPLxPT when exactly next cycle has DMA to matching BPLxDAT: write goes nowhere. (Same happens with sprites and blitter registers too, I assume all DMA channels have similar internal 2 cycle pipeline)
  * Another similar special feature is bitplane modulos, writing to BPLxMOD when exactly next cycle is matching BPLxDAT write and it also does modulo add, _old_ modulo value is used! (Write to BPLxMOD is still accepted, next time BPLxMOD value is needed it is used normally)
- sprites can be positioned on 35ns pixels - to add! - I think I did this - CHECK
- sprite scandoubling DONE (and fixed, and fixed the fix)
- bitplanes scandoubling DONE


IMPORTANT - CPU stuff
- CPU : add PACK & UNPK imstruction support (TG68KdotC_kernel.vhd, from line 2236 on -- also look at 68000 programmer's reference!) (Till Harbaum working on this, partial fix by Till Harbaum available)
- CPU really needs chipRAM 'turbo' reads AND writes!
- CPU compatibility fixes are a must!
- CPU fix cart compatibility problems (overlay detection should be moved to TG68K.vhd)
- CPU kickstart turbo - DONE, some problems remain - CHECK
- CPU chipRAM turbo - DONE, only using fastRAM path, not cached currently


MEDIUM - mostly firmware stuff
- fix firmware config, display config, mostly done, CHECK
- joystick autofire menu ?
- cpu turbo enable menu
- fast kickstart rtl / menu DONE
- 1MB kickstart


LOW - waaay down the line
- turbo blitter
- ethernet
- RTG
- AHI audio
